## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Formatting
- Parsing
- Helpful error messages

## Usage

The expected file extension of the Lyx programming language is `.lyx`.

You will only need to have the Lyx executable either in your PATH, or pointed by the `lyx.executablePath` setting, for the formatting to work as the default formatter setting is already configured for you.

## Manual installation

You will need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system. It is automatically done so when using [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv).

In the root directory of the repository:

```sh
# Install dependencies
bun install
# Build the extension
bun run package
```

Then in Visual Studio Code:

- Open the command palette (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).
- Search for and select “Developer: Install Extension from Location…”.
- Navigate to and select the root directory of the repository (`vscode-lyx`).

The extension is now installed.
